Project Idea: Flashcard Decks Web App - My favorite thing to do for classes where memorization is important is to put every important term/concept in quizlet and just read off of flashcards. Problem is, I don't have the premium subscription. Therefore, I thought this would be the coolest alternative to using that. I will just create a Web App that allows you to create, organize and study flashcards online.

The Plan: Thick-server web app where users are able to register for logging in (not real passwords and stuff), create decks, and add flashcards. All of the logic and state are server-side which is persisted in a JSON database, with a thin client to interact via REST API. Multi-user support ensures each user’s decks are private and persistent across sessions.
